Report for part 2 Plots

A* consistently finds the optimal solution because it evaluates both the actual cost from the start to the current node (g(n)) and a heuristic 
estimate (h(n)) to the goal. When the heuristic is admissible, A* guarantees an optimal path. The NN, NN2O, and RNN algorithms, on the other hand, 
tend to find suboptimal solutions due to their greedy or randomized nature. NN produces the least accurate solutions with the lowest total cost 
difference to A*, and NN2O improves this by optimizing the tour with 2-opt. RNN further improves the cost by incorporating randomness and multiple 
iterations. RNN seems to be the algorithm that often gets close to A*'s optimal cost, but A* always finds the lowest total cost but at the highest 
computational expense.

A* generally expands the most nodes compared to NN, NN2O, and RNN, as it explores many possible paths to guarantee optimality. The number of 
nodes expanded significantly increases as graph sizes grow. NN expands the fewest nodes due to its greedy approach, followed by NN2O and RNN, 
which introduce more nodes through iterations and optimizations. Although A* may expand fewer nodes in specific cases with highly accurate heuristics, 
it typically explores exponentially more nodes than the other algorithms.
